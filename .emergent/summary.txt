The previous AI engineer successfully brought Météo Sentinelle from an MVP to a more feature-rich application, building on a React, FastAPI, MongoDB stack with various weather API integrations. Initial efforts focused on core functionalities like weather overlays, pluviometer display, dynamic UI theming, and AI-driven cyclonic damage prediction. Subsequent work involved refining the AI's risk prediction to align with Météo France vigilance levels (specifically addressing modéré risk during vert vigilance), integrating Facebook/Twitter posting, implementing a robust weather data backup, and beginning the integration of advertisement slots on the homepage. The most recent significant work involved debugging and fixing a persistent cloud overlay bug on the map, which was reported by the user. This fix involved modifications to frontend components and services to ensure proper data loading, rendering, and visibility of the cloud layer, leveraging a  for root cause analysis.

<product_requirements>
Météo Sentinelle is a Guadeloupe-focused weather prediction tool designed to anticipate natural risks for citizens, communities, farmers, and emergency services. It provides 5-day forecasts, SMS/email alerts for extreme events, interactive maps with weather data (wind, rain, temperature), and local data integration. The application features a serious, modern aesthetic (deep blue, white, orange) with clear calls to action.

The initial MVP utilized a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, integrating NASA and OpenWeatherMap. Subsequent additions included: a cyclonic damage prediction AI (global/commune-specific), Météo France vigilance integration for dynamic site themes, AI risk adaptation based on humidity/heat, enhanced landing page, OpenWeatherMap data refresh/caching, cloud position, and pluviometer views. Recent work addressed overlay/pluviometer display issues, AI prediction consistency (specifically for green vigilance), API quota management, Facebook/Twitter integration, robust weather data backup, and the addition of advertisement sections on the homepage.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   ****: The main React application entry point, integrating theme management.
-   ****: Renders the homepage; recently modified to include various advertisement sections (top banner, between sections, sidebar, before footer) with new  components.
-   ****: Displays the interactive map with weather overlays and pluviometer data, focused on Guadeloupe.
-   ****: Manages the display and logic of dynamic weather overlays on the map. This file was extensively modified to resolve the cloud overlay bug:
    *   **Changes**:  was updated to immediately load data on activation.  was enhanced with detailed logs for debugging.  was improved to use a dynamic  prop for  to force re-rendering upon data changes, fixing the overlay not appearing.  for  was set to 8. Opacity for  was increased to 0.8 for better visibility. A new state variable  was introduced to manage rendering.
-   ****: Client-side service for fetching weather data.
    *   **Changes**:  statements were removed from  to clean up logs.
-   ****: Contains global CSS styles for the application.
    *   **Changes**: New styles for advertisement sections (e.g., , ) were added to support  modifications.
-   ****: The FastAPI application, defining API routes.
    *   **Changes**: Expanded API routes for AI predictions, social media, and weather backup. It was read during the cloud overlay bug diagnosis to confirm backend API behavior. No direct modifications related to the cloud overlay bug were made in this file during the recent work, but its role in providing the  is critical.
-   ****: AI model for cyclonic damage prediction.
    *   **Changes**: Previously adjusted to adapt risk based on Météo France vigilance, including drastic corrections to cap risk at modéré during verte vigilance. (Not modified in the provided trajectory).
-   ****: Handles OpenWeatherMap API interactions.
    *   **Changes**: Was read during the cloud overlay bug diagnosis to understand how  fetches overlay data. No direct modifications related to the cloud overlay bug were made in this file during the recent work.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Configure Social Media API Keys**: The user needs to provide Facebook and Twitter API keys in  for social media posting to be fully functional.
-   **Complete Ad Slots Frontend Integration**: Ensure all requested ad slot placements are correctly implemented and visually integrated on the , including final styling and responsiveness.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user-reported bug: the cloud overlay on the map ( route) was not functioning correctly despite previous backend fixes. This involved:

1.  **Diagnosis**: Inspecting frontend components (, ) and backend services (, ) to understand data flow and rendering issues.
2.  **Debugging**: Confirming backend API responses for cloud overlay data were correct.
3.  **Frontend Fixes**:
    *   Modifying  to ensure the  component re-renders when overlay data changes, by adding a dynamic  prop.
    *   Adjusting the logic in  to immediately load data upon activation.
    *   Increasing the opacity of the cloud overlay for better visibility and setting  appropriately.
4.  **Verification**: Using the  to confirm the visual fix on the frontend, and leveraging the  to identify the root cause related to  re-rendering.

The cloud overlay bug is now confirmed as resolved. Prior to this, the engineer was in the process of implementing ad slots on the  and correcting AI risk predictions based on vigilance levels, both of which are largely complete or in a good state, except for the final completion of ad slot frontend integration.
