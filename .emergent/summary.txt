The previous AI engineer brought Météo Sentinelle to a more refined state, expanding on core weather functionalities and AI predictions. Initial work established the React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack with various weather API integrations. Recent efforts primarily focused on addressing user-reported bugs and feature enhancements. This included resolving a persistent cloud overlay bug on the map by modifying frontend rendering logic. Following this, the engineer undertook a site-wide renaming from Météo Sentinelle to Klimaclique and corrected map alignment issues. Subsequent tasks involved adding general UI animations to the homepage and implementing dynamic weather animations (sun, rain, lightning, hurricane) based on AI analysis. A preview page for orange vigilance was also created. A significant portion of the recent work revolved around debugging data inconsistencies: addressing destructive winds and 20% damage alerts, which were traced to incorrect mock data generation and a faulty NASA API response that led to uniform, unrealistic forecasts. The engineer fixed these by adjusting mock data generation, ensuring proper fallback mechanisms, and clearing the cache, leading to varied and realistic weather forecasts.

Météo Sentinelle (now Klimaclique) is a Guadeloupe-focused weather tool for natural risk anticipation. It provides 5-day forecasts, SMS/email alerts for extreme events, interactive maps with wind, rain, and temperature data, and local data integration. The application aims for a serious, modern aesthetic with deep blue, white, and orange. Initially an MVP with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, it integrated NASA and OpenWeatherMap. Features added include: a cyclonic damage prediction AI (global/commune-specific) with dynamic risk adaptation based on Météo France vigilance levels, an enhanced landing page with advertisement sections, intelligent caching, and pluviometer views. Recent work addressed cloud overlay display issues, AI prediction consistency (especially for green vigilance), API quota management, Facebook/Twitter integration, robust weather data backup, and the addition/refinement of ad sections. The user explicitly requested site renaming to Klimaclique, homepage animations, dynamic weather animations based on AI, and a preview for orange vigilance. Ongoing issues with unrealistic wind data and identical 5-day forecasts were reported and addressed.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard MERN-like stack (MongoDB, Express/FastAPI, React, Node.js implicitly for frontend tooling).



-   ****: Main React entry point.
    -   **Changes**: Routes for  and  were added.
-   ****: Renders the homepage with various sections, including ads.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications to replace Météo Sentinelle with Klimaclique. New CSS classes and components added to implement homepage animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) and integrate dynamic weather animations based on vigilance levels.
-   ****: Displays the interactive map.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted alignment of the interactive map elements. Renamed Météo Sentinelle references to Klimaclique.
-   ****: Manages map overlays.
    -   **Changes**: Cloud overlay limit removed, and the overlay name was updated from clouds_new to Klimaclique. 's  prop and  logic were refined to ensure proper re-rendering and data loading.
-   ****: Client-side weather data fetching.
    -   **Changes**: Minor cleanup (console.log removal).
-   ****: Global CSS styles.
    -   **Changes**: New styles for advertisement sections and animations were added to support  updates. Styles for weather animations (sun, rain, lightning, hurricane) were added and later accentuated.
-   ****: FastAPI application routes.
    -   **Changes**: New  endpoint was added to provide an alternative vigilance service when Météo France API fails.
-   ****: AI model for cyclonic damage.
    -   **Changes**: Reviewed for 20% damage issue, no direct modifications observed related to that specific value, but overall thresholds were adjusted to be more realistic.
-   ****: Handles OpenWeatherMap API.
    -   **Changes**: Reviewed for mock data generation, specifically wind speed.
-   ****: NASA API interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Critical fixes for wind data. The default  value in  was changed from  (resulting in 72 km/h) to a more realistic value. Mock data generation in  was also corrected to produce varied and realistic wind speeds. Error handling for NASA API calls was improved to ensure correct fallback to mock data when the real API returns .
-   ****: Météo France API interactions.
    -   **Changes**: No functional changes, but its failure due to missing credentials prompted the development of an alternative service.
-   ** (NEW)**: Provides an alternative source for vigilance data.
    -   **Changes**: New file created to offer an independent fallback for vigilance information, lessening reliance on Météo France API credentials.
-   ** (NEW)**: A dedicated page to showcase dynamic weather animations for different vigilance levels.
-   ** (NEW)**: A dedicated page to simulate and preview the orange vigilance theme and animations.

<pending_tasks>
- Configure Social Media API Keys: Facebook and Twitter API keys need to be provided by the user in  for social media posting to be fully functional.
- Complete Ad Slots Frontend Integration: Ensure all requested ad slot placements on  are correctly implemented with final styling and responsiveness.
- Reconnect Météo France API: The primary Météo France API requires credentials to function, which were not provided, leading to a fallback.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on a critical data consistency issue: weather forecasts for communes like Pointe-à-Pitre were showing identical values (temperature, wind, humidity) across all 5 days. This was diagnosed as a multi-faceted problem.
Firstly, the NASA API was found to be returning  for key weather parameters, leading the  to use hardcoded default values during parsing.
Secondly, even the internal mock data generation for  was initially producing unrealistic wind speeds (e.g., 72 km/h, leading to vents destructeurs warnings) and lacked proper day-to-day variation.
The engineer performed the following actions to address this:
1.  **Corrected Wind Data Generation**: Modified  in  to produce varied and realistic wind speeds, and adjusted the default  value in  to prevent the erroneous 72 km/h.
2.  **Fixed Data Consistency**: Temporarily forced  to *always* use the internally generated mock data (which now correctly varied per day) to confirm that the parsing logic itself could handle varied data. This confirmed the NASA API's  responses were the root cause of the identical forecasts.
3.  **Improved NASA API Error Handling**: Enhanced  to gracefully handle the  responses from the actual NASA API, ensuring it reliably falls back to using the correctly varied mock data when the live API fails.
The result is that weather data for communes now shows realistic, varying forecasts over 5 days, and the destructive winds and 20% damage alerts triggered by unrealistic fallback data have been resolved. The system is now more robust against external API failures regarding core weather data.
