The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Météo Sentinelle application from its MVP stage to a more robust and functional system. The initial phase involved establishing the core React, FastAPI, MongoDB architecture with NASA GIBS and OpenWeatherMap integrations, alongside a cyclonic damage prediction AI. The trajectory highlights a strong focus on iterative development and direct response to user feedback. Key challenges tackled included persistent frontend display issues for weather overlays and the pluviometer widget, integrating dynamic Météo France vigilance with responsive UI theming, refining the AI's risk prediction logic to adapt to real-time weather and vigilance levels, and implementing an intelligent API quota management system for OpenWeatherMap. The engineer consistently diagnosed issues, applied targeted fixes in both frontend and backend, and confirmed resolutions with visual proof and API test results. The process culminated in all reported issues being resolved, delivering a performant and adaptively themed application.

<product_requirements>
The Météo Sentinelle project aims to be an innovative local weather prediction tool for Guadeloupe, designed to anticipate natural risks like cyclones and floods. It targets citizens, communities, farmers, and emergency services. Core features include 5-day weather predictions with risk indicators, SMS/email alerts for extreme events, interactive maps showing wind, rain, temperature, and alerts, and local data combining weather, topography, and historical impact. The desired aesthetic is a serious, modern style with deep blue, white, and orange, featuring clear calls to action.

Initial work established a React frontend and FastAPI backend with MongoDB, integrating NASA and OpenWeatherMap APIs with intelligent caching. A full-screen interactive map for Guadeloupe's 32 communes was developed. Subsequent user requests included: implementing a predictive AI for cyclonic damage with global and detailed commune views; integrating Météo France vigilances to dynamically change site colors; making AI risk logic adaptive to real-time humidity/heat; enhancing the landing page; implementing an OpenWeatherMap data refresh/caching strategy; and adding cloud position and pluviometer views to the map. The immediate past focus was resolving display issues for map overlays and the pluviometer, followed by refining AI adaptation and implementing API quota management.

<pending_tasks>
All explicit pending tasks mentioned at the beginning of the trajectory (resolving frontend display issues for overlays and pluviometer, and ensuring vigilance adaptation) have been successfully resolved. No new pending tasks were explicitly requested by the user after the final fixes.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was addressing the final set of user-reported issues and optimizing resource usage. This involved:

1.  **Debugging Cloud Overlays Display**: The user reported that cloud overlays were still not visible.
    *   **Diagnosis**: The problem was traced to an incorrect OpenWeatherMap tile URL format being used in  ( instead of ). Additionally, the frontend component  was found to be constructing its own URLs instead of consuming the correct  provided by the backend.
    *   **Fixes**: The URL format in 's  was corrected, and  was modified to fetch and use the  from the backend's  endpoint. A temporary cache bypass was also implemented in the backend during debugging.

2.  **Refining AI Risk Adaptation**: The user noted that the AI's risk level was consistently modéré even under vert vigilance, and it wasn't adapting sufficiently.
    *   **Diagnosis**: The AI's  thresholds were too high, and a base score of +8 for normal conditions was pushing scores into modéré territory even for calm weather.
    *   **Fixes**: The  thresholds in  were adjusted (, ). The base score for normal conditions was reduced from +8 to +3 to allow for faible risk predictions during green vigilance and normal weather.

3.  **Implementing API Quota Management**: The OpenWeatherMap API hit its rate limit (429 error), making the AI unresponsive.
    *   **Solution**: A comprehensive API quota management system was implemented. This involved creating  to distribute 1000 daily requests optimally with intelligent caching (3-hour validity per commune) and  to schedule hourly updates for priority communes, daily cache cleaning, and quota resets. Fallback to simulated data was also integrated into  if the API became unavailable. Backend endpoints were added to expose quota status and allow forced updates.

The work concluded with all these issues confirmed as resolved, leading to a fully functional application with dynamic theming, accurate AI predictions, visible overlays, optimized map navigation, and robust API quota management.
